Real-time visibility of Dumper load status to Shovel operator

Description
Challenge Description: In large-scale mining, shovel operators are responsible for loading materials onto dumpers. However, the lack of real-time visibility regarding the load status of dumpers often leads to inefficiencies and delays in the overall workflow. Currently, shovel operators rely on manual communication or visual cues to determine whether a dumper is ready for loading or its loading has been completed. The challenge is to create a system that provides shovel operators with instant and accurate information about the load status of dumpers, eliminating the need for manual communication and improving the efficiency of the operation. The solution should leverage real-time data from sensors or other reliable sources to deliver timely updates to shovel operators, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their loading process. The solution should address the following key aspects: Real-time Monitoring: Develop a mechanism to continuously monitor the load status of dumpers in real time. This may involve integrating sensors, IoT devices, or any other suitable technology to collect and transmit data reliably. Visualization and Alerts: Design an intuitive interface that displays the load status of each dumper to the shovel operator in real time. The interface should provide clear visual indicators and notifications to inform the operator about the readiness of each dumper for loading as well as inform the shove operator when the loading of the dumper is completed. Data Integration: Create a system that seamlessly integrates with existing infrastructure, such as the shovel operator's workstation or control panel. The solution should ensure smooth data transmission and compatibility with other systems or software used in the mining site. Scalability and Robustness: Develop a solution that can handle a large number of dumpers
